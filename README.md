# Text Summarization using NLP

This project focuses on developing a system for summarizing the top 5 articles returned by a scoring utility based on a user query. The objective is to generate a coherent and informative summary in natural language format, consolidating key insights from the selected articles.

## Overview

Text summarization is a critical task in NLP, enabling users to extract the most relevant information from extensive text data efficiently. This project explores both **extractive** and **abstractive** text summarization methods:

- **Extractive Summarization**: Selects and combines key sentences or phrases from the original text.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates summaries by paraphrasing the content using a deep learning model.

The project leverages pre-trained NLP models and tokenizers to perform these tasks, showcasing the efficiency of modern techniques in understanding and summarizing textual data.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning and tokenizing the input text for effective summarization.
- **Implementation of Extractive and Abstractive Models**: Demonstrates the application of traditional and modern approaches for summarization.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses metrics like ROUGE scores to assess the quality of generated summaries.

## Results

The system will output a single, cohesive summary that gives the essential information from the top 5 articles relevant to the user's query. This summary will serve as a concise and informative response, enabling users to grasp the main insights and findings without needing to read through each article individually.

**Conclusion**

This project aims to demonstrate the integration of advanced NLP techniques for both information retrieval and summarization tasks. By combining efficient article ranking with effective summarization methods, the system facilitates efficient knowledge extraction and dissemination, catering to the needs of users seeking comprehensive insights from multiple sources
