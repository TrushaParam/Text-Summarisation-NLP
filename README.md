#### Project Overview: Summarization of Top 5 Articles

This project focuses on developing a system for summarizing the top 5 articles returned by a scoring utility based on a user query. The objective is to generate a coherent and informative summary in natural language format, consolidating key insights from the selected articles.

**Output**
The system will output a single, cohesive summary that distills the essential information from the top 5 articles relevant to the user's query. This summary will serve as a concise and informative response, enabling users to grasp the main insights and findings without needing to read through each article individually.

**Conclusion**
This project aims to demonstrate the integration of advanced NLP techniques for both information retrieval and summarization tasks. By combining efficient article ranking with effective summarization methods, the system facilitates efficient knowledge extraction and dissemination, catering to the needs of users seeking comprehensive insights from multiple sources
